# DownScaling-of-Satellite-Based-on-Air-Quality-Map-Using-AI-ML
Air pollution is a major threat to public health and the environment. Traditional AQI prediction methods struggle with non-linear patterns. This project proposes a hybrid model using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Improved Extreme Learning Machine (IELM) to improve AQI forecasting accuracy.
