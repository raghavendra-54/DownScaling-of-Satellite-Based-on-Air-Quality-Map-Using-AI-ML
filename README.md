# DownScaling-of-Satellite-Based-on-Air-Quality-Map-Using-AI-ML
Air pollution is a major threat to public health and the environment. Traditional AQI prediction methods struggle with non-linear patterns. This project proposes a hybrid model using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Improved Extreme Learning Machine (IELM) to improve AQI forecasting accuracy.

## ðŸ§ª ML Models Used

- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

The user can select a model and see its accuracy based on training/testing data split after preprocessing and balancing.

## ðŸ“ˆ How It Works

1. Upload or load `city_day.csv` containing pollutant data.
2. Preprocess the dataset (null value imputation, encoding, balancing).
3. Train selected ML models.
4. Predict AQI category (Poor, Satisfactory, Good) based on new inputs.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ”§ Installation

ðŸ§  Prediction Categories
0 â†’ Poor

1 â†’ Satisfactory

2 â†’ Good

The model is trained to classify inputs into these three AQI categories using pollution and meteorological parameters.
